# array-list-data-structure

**Defining ADT (Abstract Data Type)**

Create a list data structure with following functions:

1. Retrieve element at an index: Time complexity should be O(n).
2. Insert element at an index: 
3. Update element at an index: 
4. Delete element at an index: 
5. size of the list: 
6. check to see if list is empty: 

Make sure that this is a dynamic list and size adjusts automatically.

Make sure all index operations throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException for invalid index.

**Assumption**:

List is of integer type.
