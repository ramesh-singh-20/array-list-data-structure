# array-list-data-structure

**Defining ADT (Abstract Data Type)**

Create a list data structure with following functions:

1. Retrieve an element at an index: Time complexity should be O(1).
2. Insert an element at an index: Time complexity should be O(n).
3. Update an element at an index: Time complexity should be O(1).
4. Delete an element at an index: Time complexity should be O(n).
5. size of the list: Time complexity should be O(1).
6. check to see if list is empty: Time complexity should be O(1).

Make sure that this is a dynamic list and size adjusts automatically.

Make sure all index operations throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException for invalid index.

**Assumption**:

List is of integer type.

**Testing**

Spock framework with Groovy is used for unit testing.
